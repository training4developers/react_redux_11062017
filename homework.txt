Exercise


1. Ensure the Car Tool application

 a. Displays a table of cars
 b. Add a cars
 c. Delete a cars
 d. All of the async operations

2. Write mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps functions for CarTool.

Do not create a container or use connect or anything to make it all work. Simply write the functions.

Look at the state and actions inside Car Tool. The state and actions will be moved to Redux, therefore what needs to be passed a props (data and functions) for the application to still work.
