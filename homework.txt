Homework

1. Create a store for managing a list of colors. Do not store colors on a rest service, only use the memory of the store.

state = {
  colors: []
}

2. The following actions should be supported: adding a color and deleting a color.

3. Using the color tool components (or create new ones), to display a list of colors.

4. Each color row should have a delete button which fires a delete action for the color.

 { ...state, colors: state.colors.slice(0,1).concat(state.colors.slice(2) };

5. Under the color list, should be a color form which accepts new color and when the button is clicked, an add color action is fired off adding the new color.

{ ...state, colors: state.colors.concat(newColor) }

Bonus: Use component lifecycle functions and "forceUpdate" to manage the connection between the component tree and the Redux store. Do this instead of calling ReactDOM.render twice.
